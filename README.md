# What are the hardest ultramarathons in the world?

Ultra running as a sport has been around for over 100 years but has rapidly grown in popularity recently in large part because of people such as David Goggins and Cam Hanes. An ultramarathon is a race that is longer than the typical 26.2 mile marathon distance. These races range from 50k (31.1 miles) to 50 miles to 100 miles and beyond. Due to the nature of the courses they are run on, factors such as terrain, weather, and elevation change have a huge impact on the difficulty of the course.

This analysis attempts to rank ultramarathons around the world based on factors such as distance, participant average speed, and average number of finishers. The data was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihyavuzz/two-centuries-of-um-races) and contains data on 1,048,575 ultramarathon finishers between the years of 2016 and 2018.
